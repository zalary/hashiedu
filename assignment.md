This is a technical writing and editing project as part of your interview.

This project is designed to take between 1.5 - 2 hours.
Please take the time to carefully review the [writing style guide](../styling-guide-snippet.md) and the [layout guide](../guide-template.md).

## Instructions

Before you start editing, you should set up a working environment and learn about our editing process.

Create a git repository on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any other git hosting service. 

Read the style guide snippets, which is a subset of our official engineering style guide, and the guide template. Then make improvements to the sample prose, so it embodies the principles in the style guide. 

### Get started

We recommend you clone the project to your local workstation. Use the Code button on the main project page to retrieve the URL and issue the `git clone` command on your workstation.

Alternatively, you may download the [terraform-getting-started.md](terraform-getting-started.md) file. This file is located in the `education-engineer` folder. You can also download the entire project as a zip.

Another option is to copy the file content to your local workstation. To view the file content, click on the file [terraform-getting-started.md](terraform-getting-started.md) from GitHub. Click on the "Raw" button when viewing the individual file and copy the content. Before editing, commit the initial [terraform-getting-started.md](terraform-getting-started.md) file to the repo that you have created for this project.

**NOTE**: DO NOT FORK THE PROJECT. MAKE A COPY OF ALL FILES, CREATE YOUR OWN FRESH REPOSITORY AND SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST TOWARDS YOUR OWN PROJECT.

### Edit the sample

Now that your environment is set up, you can start to edit the file [terraform-getting-started.md](terraform-getting-started.md) on your local machine. Complete the following tasks, make all changes in Markdown.

- Look for and fix any spelling or grammar issues.
- Edit the text for readability and compatibility with the style guide.
- Run the code and paste the terminal output in Markdown for all the commands. 
- Add section titles that are compatible with the guide template.
- Add learning objectives to the introduction.
- Add additional sections and content for both prerequisites and next steps. 

#### Assumptions: 
- The audience has none to minimal experience with Terraform.

### Submit your sample

- Commit your changes to the `terraform-getting-started.md` file and push to the repository.
- Open a pull request. If you are not familiar with the pull request process, review the documentation for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html), or [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-pull-request-to-merge-your-change/). 
- Send the pull request link to your recruiting contact for review. It will be easiest if this is a public repository.
